<h1>I Finished My Homework!</h1>

<div class="row">
  <div id=div1 class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><p id="clr1" class=partitle>Title 1</p><p class=par>This homework took me a really long time to do, and while I've learned a lot, I've still got a long way to go. That estimate of, "one or two hours," was way too optimistic for me; this took closer to 5 hours to complete.</p></div>
  <div id=div2 class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><p id="clr2" class=partitle>Title 2</p><p class=par>Also, I still have a lot to learn. For example, ideally I would like to this text to wrap around the title in the top-right corner, but I couldn't figure that out. Instead I just put extra padding at the top of the element.</p>
  </div>
  <div id=div3 class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><p id="clr3" class=partitle>Title 3</p><p class=par>Still, all in all, I'm really pround of myself. I think I've satified the assignment requirements, and it doesn't look half bad, in my humble opinion. Considering I only had a little coding knowledge coming in to this course, I think I'm doing OK.</p></div>
